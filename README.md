# Analyzing Public Transportation and Traffic Linked to Weather Conditions in Istanbul

## Project Description

This project addresses the transportation issue in Istanbul. Due to various transportation options in the city and people's ability to switch between alternatives, there are various transportation options for each route. In our research, we investigated the impact of weather conditions on the selection of these alternatives. We attempted to predict how much demand a particular mode of transportation might receive based on weather conditions and other transportation data.

The project covers end-to-end processes, including creating a pipeline, data manipulation, data exploration, data analysis, and modeling. Throughout these stages, various analyses were conducted to find answers to the problem's questions, and opportunities and challenges were encountered.
